    "originalMessage": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this . The user wants to translate \"hiiii\" into Russian while keeping the exact tone and style. First, I need to figure out the message type and tone. \"hiiii\" is a greeting with multiple 'i's, which makes it more casual and friendly, maybe even a bit playful or enthusiastic.\n\nLooking at the previous chat context, there's a lot of back-and-forth with casual greetings like \"чё как?\" and \"wassup\". The users are using informal Russian and English slang. The response to \"hiiii\" should fit into this casual, friendly vibe.\n\nIn Russian, the standard greeting is \"Привет\". But since the original has \"hiiii\" with extra letters, which adds a playful or excited tone, I should find an equivalent in Russian. Sometimes people stretch letters in Russian for effect, like \"Привеет\" or \"Привииииет\". However, the user's instruction says not to normalize or rewrite, so I need to check if there's a common way to stretch greetings in Russian.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, when translating \"wassup\" to \"чё как?\" and vice versa, the key is to maintain the slang and casualness. For \"hiiii\", the closest Russian equivalent that's casual and playful would be \"Привет\" with some letter stretching. Maybe \"Привеет\" or \"Привииет\" to mimic the extra 'i's. But I need to ensure it's natural in Russian internet slang. Another possibility is \"Привет-привет\" but that might be too much. Considering the examples given, the user might expect a simple but stretched version. So \"Привеет\" seems appropriate, as it's a common way to add playfulness without overdoing it. Alternatively, \"Привииииет\" with multiple 'и's to match the \"hiiii\". However, in Russian, stretching vowels in greetings isn't as common as in English. Maybe \"Привет\" with an extra 'е' or 'т' at the end. Wait, in the example, \"wassup\" was translated to \"чё как?\", which is a direct slang equivalent. So for \"hiiii\", the direct equivalent would be \"Привет\" but with some stretching. Since the user wrote \"hiiii\", which is",
